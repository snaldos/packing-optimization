# DP OPTIMIZED (2 Rolling Rows)

## DATASET 01

The optimized DP approach with two rolling rows is the most memory-efficient, using only 808 bytes for 202 entries. It is also the fastest among the DP methods. However, it cannot reconstruct the set of used pallets, only the maximum profit. This makes it ideal for large datasets where only the optimal value is needed and not the actual selection of items.

## DATASET 02

The optimized DP approach (2 rolling rows) finds the correct maximum profit (32) with minimal memory (808 B) and very fast execution (25 μs). As before, it cannot reconstruct the used pallets, but is ideal for large datasets or when only the optimal value is needed.

## DATASET 03

The optimized DP approach (2 rolling rows) finds the correct maximum profit (40) with minimal memory (808 B) and very fast execution (11 μs). As before, it cannot reconstruct the used pallets, but is ideal for large datasets or when only the optimal value is needed.
