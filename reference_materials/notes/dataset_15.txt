In this example, following a DP approach, using a HashMap as a table structure would end up using a lot less entries and being less memory expensive than using a 2D vector table.

Optimal solution:

id, profit, weight
2, 7, 10
4, 9, 10
6, 8, 10
7, 6, 10
9, 10, 10
12, 7, 10
14, 9, 10
16, 8, 10
17, 6, 10
19, 10, 10
22, 7, 10
24, 9, 10
26, 8, 10
27, 6, 10
29, 10, 10

Total Weight: 150
Maximum Profit: 120
