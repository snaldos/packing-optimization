In this example, the greedy algorithm gets a solution very far away from the optimal (exactly half of it).
Also the backtrack solution that proved to be very time efficient in the other scenarios took a while to find the optimal solution.

Optimal solution:

id, profit, weight
51, 1000, 100

Total Weight: 100
Maximum Profit: 1000
