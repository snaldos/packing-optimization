In this example, the greedy algorithm gets a solution very far away from the optimal
Also the backtrack solution that proved to be very time efficient in the other scenarios took a while to find the optimal solution.

Optimal solution:

id, profit, weight
51, 999, 100

Total Weight: 100
Maximum Profit: 999
